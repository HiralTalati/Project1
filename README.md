# Project_Selfreplicatingvirus


This is Self Replicating Virus which gets installed to non-infected python files once code runs(virus.py)
Further the infected files can even pass this virus to other non-infected newly created files.
For which, it donot even require the main file (i.e. virus.py). This justifies the given name.
It is designed entirely using python.
